# UI test plan

The `test-ui` skill runs each case in a fresh Bkxss process. Inputs are sent in
order, followed by `bye`. Expected output includes only the responses to the
listed inputs, not the greeting or farewell. Each case uses a temporary working directory so existing task data stays intact.

## GUI checks: A-BetterGui

Run the GUI from a temporary working directory with a fresh data file.

1. At startup, confirm that the command field has focus and Send is disabled.
   Spaces alone must keep Send disabled; Enter must not create empty messages.
   The subtitle should read `Your task butler, at your service!`, and the title,
   controls, focus state, and user messages should use the blue visual theme.
2. Enter `todo borrow book`, `mark 2`, `mark 1`, `list`, `todo`, then `list`.
   Commands should be compact and right-aligned; replies should be full-width cards.
   Each command should show the circular cat avatar on the right. Each Bkxss reply
   should show the circular dog avatar on the left.
   Only `mark 2` and `todo` should have a red card headed CHECK YOUR COMMAND.
   Both lists must contain exactly one completed task.
3. Add `todo OhNo!! ERROR :( --> investigate`. Its successful reply must use normal styling.
4. Add a task with a long description and run `list`. Resize the window to its
   minimum size and then to 900 × 700. Text should wrap without truncation or
   horizontal scrolling, and the input and Send button should remain usable.
5. Send enough commands to overflow the conversation. Each new reply should scroll
   into view; scrolling upward should still let you read earlier replies.
   The pale-blue `chatbot_background` world map should fill the conversation viewport
   without tiling, while every message remains easy to read.
6. Use both Enter and Send. Focus should return to the input after sending.
7. Enter `bye`. The farewell should remain visible and both input and Send should
   be disabled. Relaunch and confirm the saved task state is preserved.

## Storage checks: A-MoreErrorHandling

`StorageTest` and `ErrorHandlingTest` automate these fixture-based checks.
Use temporary working directories for manual console verification as well.

1. Start with no data file, add and mark a task, then restart and list it.
   The task must still be completed.
2. Put valid records before and after a malformed record in `data/bkxss.txt`.
   Startup must report the bad line; `list` must contain both valid records.
   Attempt `todo new`, `mark 1`, or `delete 1`: expect an error asking for
   repair/restart, with the list and original file unchanged.
3. Repeat with invalid completion flags, impossible stored deadline/event
   dates, equal/reversed event boundaries, duplicate tasks, and invalid UTF-8.
   Never silently replace an unreadable or partially loaded file.
4. Make the data file read-only, or use a regular file where its parent
   directory should be. Attempt task changes: expect `I couldn't save your
   tasks. No changes were applied.` with guidance about permissions/disk space.
   No success message may appear, and list contents/statuses must be unchanged.
5. Repair permissions or the blocked parent after a save failure and retry.
   Saving must work again. After a failed load, repair the data and restart.
6. Load an older event with `Mon 2pm to 4pm`. Listing/deletion must work;
   `findfree` must ask for dated boundaries. New free-text events must be rejected.

## Test case: Create todo task

```

### Expected output

```text
Got it. I've added this task:
